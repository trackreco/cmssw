// Val* -- persistent records of the synthetic validation of propagation,

//
// These deliberately hold PLAIN members only (scalars and fixed float arrays),
// so that:
//   - a file written here is readable in a bare root.exe session after
//     gSystem->Load("libMkFitRootDataFormats.so"), with no mkFit build at all;
//   - RDataFrame sees every member as a column with no per-type boilerplate.

// No residual, pull or ratio is ever stored: those are RDF Defines over these
// columns, so a residual can be redefined without regenerating the sample.

//
//   O -> A   conditioning leg, result kept as the input state
//   A -> B   the step under test
//   B -> A'  the return, onto the SAME plane A
//
// PLANE A is at the ORIGIN with its normal along the momentum there, so it is
// perfectly conditioned (n.dx/ds = 1) and the return leg contributes no error
// of its own. Everything measured is then a property of the OUTBOUND step.
//
// PLANE B is placed at a chosen TURN ANGLE from A -- not at a chosen radius.
// The propagator solves for a path length s satisfying n.(x(s) - p) = 0; it
// does not propagate "to a radius", and a radius is not a control: it sets both
// how far the step goes and how squarely the track meets the surface, and
// couples them. The two real controls are the turn angle and the incidence
// angle at B, and both are scanned directly. r_b and z_b are reported so the
// configuration stays picturable, not because they steer anything.
//
// The conditioning leg is not optional. A propagate-to-SURFACE has a rank-5
// jacobian, so its output covariance is degenerate along the plane normal; a
// round trip started from a full-rank 6x6 cannot close however correct the
// propagator is. Starting from a state that is itself the output of one
// propagation onto A is also what the real code always feeds in.

// The question: propagate a covariance C_A through the production code path to

// identically on both legs, and a marginal-by-marginal comparison cannot see a
