// SensorGapMap: where a layer has no sensor, from the module outlines of the geometry.
//
// A straight segment through a layer either crosses a module's active rectangle or passes through a gap: between
// two modules of a ladder along z, between two ladders in phi, or beyond the layer's ends. A particle that crosses
// a gap leaves no hit there. Measured on B2 (2026-10-04, cmssw_20_mkseed v2p2-seeds/adv/README.md): 310 of 320
// particles without a B2 hit crossed a gap, against 0.16 % of the particles with one.
//
// Built for flat barrel layers: the modules are grouped into ladders (one plane each), and a ladder keeps the z
// intervals of its modules. A query intersects the segment with the ladders near its phi and reports a gap when no
// ladder's module covers the crossing by more than the margin, so a crossing within the margin of an edge counts
// as a gap. Layers that are not flat barrel layers have no map (has_map() false).
//
// The interface is meant to take dead regions as well (dead modules or readout chips from the conditions), as
// further rectangles that do not cover; not built yet.
